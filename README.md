# 💼 Md Najib Ul Azam Mahi - Developer Portfolio

Modern, polished Full Stack Developer portfolio showcasing AI-integrated applications, REST API development, and production-ready web solutions. Built with **React (Vite)**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and a fully custom CSS design-token system.

## 🚀 Major UI Upgrade — v2.0

This release is a complete visual and architectural overhaul. Every section has been redesigned and a reusable component library has been built from scratch.

### What Changed

| Area | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Cards | Ad-hoc Tailwind classes | `ModernCard` — glassmorphic, gradient border reveal on hover |
| Buttons | Inline variants | `PrimaryButton` — solid-gradient + ghost-gradient, WCAG touch targets |
| Sections | Repeated markup | `Section` + `SectionHeading` — consistent layout tokens |
| Entry point | Bare `<main>` | `Layout` — IntersectionObserver scroll-reveal with reduced-motion support |
| Hero tech stack | Static icon list | `TechMarquee` — infinite CSS-scroll animated pill strip |
| YouTube embeds | Eager `<iframe>` | `YouTubeFacade` — click-to-load, eliminates cold network cost on page load |
| Footer | Plain links | `BackToTop` button + modernised social links |
| About section | Standalone page | Removed — content compressed into Hero & Contact |
| Assets | Mixed PNG/JPG | All converted to **WebP** for faster load times |
| SEO | Basic meta | `robots.txt` + `sitemap.xml` added |
| CSS | Scattered utilities | Full **CSS custom-property design token** system |

## ✨ Features

### Design & UI/UX
- **CSS Design Token System** — all colours, surfaces, borders, and glows driven by `--c-*` and `--site-*` custom properties; trivial to theme
- **Glassmorphic Navbar** (`nav-shell`) with scroll-spy active section tracking and blurred backdrop
- **Hero Section** — floating radial orbs background, animated profile glow, three status badges (Open to Work, Freelance Available, Remote Friendly)
- **ModernCard** — `backdrop-blur` surface with a gradient border that fades in on hover via CSS `mask-composite` technique
- **TechMarquee** — infinite-scroll animated tech stack strip at the bottom of the hero; duplicated for seamless looping
- **YouTubeFacade** — shows a YouTube thumbnail image; full `<iframe>` is only injected into the DOM after user click, cutting three cold connections on load
- **Layout / Scroll-Reveal** — `IntersectionObserver`-powered `.reveal-on-scroll` system; gracefully degrades for `prefers-reduced-motion` and older browsers
- **BackToTop** — smooth animated button that fades in after scrolling
- Fully responsive design optimised for all screen sizes
- Dark mode ready via Tailwind `dark:` variants and CSS custom properties

### Technical Features
- Clean, modular React component architecture with purpose-built reusable primitives
- CSS custom-property design token system (no magic hex values in component files)
- Lazy-load YouTube embeds — no layout shift, no cold-connection cost
- IntersectionObserver scroll-reveal with reduced-motion and no-JS fallbacks
- WebP image assets for optimised load performance
- SEO: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, Open Graph meta tags

## 🎨 Design System Highlights

- **Design Token Variables:** All colours and surfaces are CSS custom properties — no magic hex values in component files
- **ModernCard border technique:** `linear-gradient` applied via `mask-composite: exclude` to reveal a gradient border only on hover, with zero DOM overhead
- **TechMarquee:** Two identical `<ul>` sets laid out with `translateX` CSS animation creating a seamless infinite loop; `aria-hidden` on the duplicate set
- **YouTubeFacade:** `hqdefault.jpg` thumbnail from YouTube's CDN used as a static preview; iframe injected only on click
- **Scroll-reveal:** `IntersectionObserver` with `rootMargin: 0px 0px -10% 0px` and `threshold: 0.15`; falls back to immediate visibility for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Button system:** `btn-gradient` (solid, 200% background-size with hover position shift) and `btn-ghost-gradient` (transparent fill, gradient border)
